Interactive Python Dashboards with Plotly Dash

In this project, I have created a python interactive dashbaord with plotly Dash.
Web based dashbaords are a great way to display and share information with others. Plotly Dash is the go-to library for creating interactive and beautiful web applications.

* Below are the steps involved.
* Exploring the dataset.
* Setting up python environment, I have used Pycharm Editor-community edition.
* Preparing to build the Dash app.
* Building the layout of the dashbaord.
* Adding interactivity to the dashbaord.
* Running the dashbaord.
